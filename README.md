# Python Portfolio

This repository documents my structured journey learning Python from fundamentals to data-focused programming and AI preparation.

The projects are organized according to the course module progression and demonstrate clean coding practices, problem-solving skills, and practical application of concepts.

## Course-Aligned Structure

01-introduction  
Basic Python setup and simple scripts.

02-variables-expressions  
Variables, data types, arithmetic operations, type conversion, and expressions.

03-conditional-code  
Decision-making using if, elif, else statements and logical operators.

04-functions  
Modular programming using functions, parameters, return values, and code reuse.

05-loops-iterations  
Repetition using for and while loops, iteration patterns, and loop control.

06-data-structures  
Lists, dictionaries, tuples, and structured data handling.

mini-projects  
Practical real-world Python applications combining multiple concepts.
